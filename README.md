<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>

I'm a fullstack developer with experience building web platforms and applications. \
Additionally, I have hands-on experience working with microcontrollers including Arduino, ESP32, and STM32 for hardware prototyping and IoT projects.\
I prioritize accessibility, performance, and writing secure, maintainable, and robust code. I also enjoy helping others and collaborating whenever possible. I love open source because contributing, supporting, and giving back to the community not only benefits others but also helps me.



<h3>EXPERIENCE</h3>

I have experience working in both private companies and as a freelancer.

I've spent most of my time as a developer working with:
